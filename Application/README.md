Files in this folder contain R scripts to reproduce analysis of the German Reunification data in the manuscript "Theory for Identification and Inference with
Synthetic Controls: A Proximal Causal Inference Framework".

Below are the R scripts to implement analysis:
* Application_GermanReunification.R: analysis of German Reunification data as described in Section 5 of the manuscript (require Application_GermanReunification_functions.R);
* Conformal_Pointwise_CI.R: conformal prediction intervals for the treatment effects of German Reunification on per-capita GDP of West Germany, as described in Section A.3 of the Supplementary Materials.
